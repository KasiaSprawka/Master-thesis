\chapter{Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI}
	
Medical Imaging started with the development of X-rays by Wilhelm Röntgen in 1895, for which he received a Nobel Price \cite{rontgen1896new}. 
An enormous progress has been done since that time and numerous different imaging methods were developed, which found various applications in a medical field. Possibility of creating  visual representations of human interior as well as tissues and organs processes thus functionality much facilitated medical diagnosis and prognosis.   
Some imaging techniques has became an integral part of clinical care (i.e Computer Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Positron Emission Tomography), whereas there exist one, which still needs to prove its utility. 

In this chapter the imaging technique, which is DCE-MRI will be introduced and its mechanism of imaging will be presented.

\section{Fundamentals of MRI}
In order to understand the mechanism of acquiring DCE-MRI sequences, it is inevitable to introduce the principle of operation of \textit{Magnetic Resonance Imaging}~(MRI).

MRI is an imaging technique based on the phenomena of induced nuclear  magnetism in the patient. Every molecule possessing a nuclei with an odd number of protons or neutrons  have a spin, implying a weak though observable randomly oriented nuclear magnetic moment. 
This particles include for example \textsuperscript{1}H, \textsuperscript{13}C, \textsuperscript{31}P, \textsuperscript{23}Na, \textsuperscript{19}F \nocite{bronzino1999biomedical}\cite{biomedical_hanbook_imaging}. If placed in a strong static magnetic field, these moments strongly tend to align parallel to the external field. Some of them will align antiparallel to the field, however there will always be an excess of these directed towards the direction of the field, as this state is more energetically stable. The resulting net magnetic moment, $M_0$, will be directed with the external field.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging explicit the fact that the human body in 80\% consists of water. During the MRI examination, the object is placed in the scanner producing strong magnetic field, which causes the hydrogen atoms to align in the direction of the field, pointing towards the head of the object as shown in the Figure~\ref{fig:magnetic_field}. 

\begin{figure}

		\label{fig:magnetic_field}
	\end{figure}

In addition, atoms have an angular momentum making them precess about the magnetic field direction with a frequency $\omega_{0}$, called the \textit{Larmor frequency}, which is proportional to the field:   
\begin{equation}
\omega_{0} = \gamma{}B_{0}\:,
\label{eq:larmor}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma$ is the nuclei specific constant \textit{gyromagnetic ratio} (for hydrogen equal to 42.6\,MHz/T) and $B_{0}$ is the strength of the external magnetic field. This preccessional motion is is showed on Figure~\ref{fig:larmor}.

\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\includegraphics [width =6cm]{larmor}
		\caption [Precessional motion of the atom in the magnetic field]{Hydrogen atom placed in a strong magnetic field $B_0$ precesses about the direction of that field with the frequency $\omega_{0}$ \cite{?}}
		\label{fig:larmor}
	\end{figure}
Further, when the radio-frequency (RF) pulse equal to the Larmor frequency is applied perpendicularly to the magnetic field, the resonance occurs. The atoms absorb the energy, transits to the higher energy state and flip to the other position.
When the RF transmission is stopped, the atoms return to their equilibrium state (realign to the field $B_{0})$ releasing the energy as a radiation signal, referred to as \textit{free-induction decay} (FID) response signal, which is picked by MRI receiver. This return to equilibrium is called \textit{relaxation}. The relaxation time as well as the amount of the energy released strongly depends on the magnetic properties of the tissue, which means that every tissue generates different response signal. The MRI software analyses and processes obtained signal, which is a combination of numerous response signals from all excited atoms and generates the~image.       

During the MRI examination, the strength of the magnetic field produced by the scanner varies along the body, so that the Larmor frequency is different for different regions. By changing frequency of emitted RF, the appropriate part can be imagined. 

The typical MRI scanner consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{The main field magnets}, which produces strong, uniform magnetic field polarizing the sample. Typical strength of the field of a clinical MRI scanner ranges between 0.2--3.0\, T, whereas research systems reaches values even up to 7.4\, T for Human and 21\, T for animal models.
\item \textbf{Shim coils.} In clinical practice, the main field magnets never produce perfectly uniform field so the shim coils adjusting its homogeneity have to be used.   
\item \textbf{Gradient coils} producing three secondary gradient magnetic fields in each of the x, y and z direction. In this way, the resonance frequency of protons varies as a function of position, which enables encoding the spatial position and imaging of thin anatomic slices \cite{hidalgo2010theory}.
\item \textbf{RF system}, task of which is to excite the hydrogen atoms and to receive their FID response signal
\item \textbf{The strong computer} controlling the system and processing the received combination of response signals.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\textit{T\textsubscript{1}} and \textit{T\textsubscript{2}} weighted images}

Although, there are few approaches of obtaining the contrast between different tissues in an image, utilizing different tissue properties, most widely used in clinical applications are these based on the relaxation of the magnetization. However, there are two kinds of relaxation, and thus two mechanisms of creating the MRI image can be listed.
\begin{description}
		\item [\textit{T\textsubscript{1}} weighted images] exploits spin–lattice relaxation, characterised by the time \textit{T\textsubscript{1}}, which describes the time required by excited atoms to return to the equilibrium state after it was altered by the RF pulse. This mechanism is shown in Figure \ref{fig:t1plot}. Sometimes the acquiring of T\textsubscript{1} weighted sequence is preceded by the injection of Gadolinium, paramagnetic contrast agent (CA), which  shortens time {T\textsubscript{1}} and appears very bright on the image. This property is especially useful while visualising vascular structures or brain tumours and abscesses blocking a blood supply.   
		
		\item [\textit{T\textsubscript{2}} weighted images] are based on spin-to-spin relaxation, described by the \textit{T\textsubscript{2}} indicating the time required by the nuclei response signal to decay after it has been created. \textit{T\textsubscript{2}} contrast is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:t2plot}. 
\end{description}
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
Examples of the images acquired using described above two basic mechanisms are shown in Figure \ref{fig:t1t2}. 
The figure presents identical axial section of a healthy person's brain. In the \textit{T\textsubscript{1}} weighted  image on the left-hand side, one can notice bright ring of subcutaneous fat, which is due to its short spin–lattice relaxation time. Gray matter has longer \textit{T\textsubscript{1}} than white matter, so it appears darker. In the second picture, utilizing the \textit{T\textsubscript{2}} difference between tissues, cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles appears very bright due to its long  \textit{T\textsubscript{2}}. \textit{T\textsubscript{2}} of the white matter is shorter that those of gray matter, which makes the latter one brighter. \textit{T\textsubscript{1}} and \textit{T\textsubscript{2}} weighted images are only two of the few contrast mechanisms used in  MRI and the choice of appropriate one strongly depends on the application and the region of interest under examination.

Currently MRI is one of the widest used medical imaging techniques applied in all parts of a body. It enables creating detailed anatomical images in axial, sagittal, coronal or even oblique plane. During MRI examination subsequent thin 2D \textit{slices} along chosen axis are produced, which makes it a tomographic imaging method. As a result, during imaging sequence, a large dataset is acquired, from which any anatomical section can be reconstructed or a 3D model of a region of interest can be assembled \cite {bushong2014magnetic}. Another advantage of MRI is not using any harmful ionizing radiation.
The clicical applications of MRI include diagnosis of blood vessel damages, multiple sclerosis, brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, brain strokes, blocked blood vessels, heart diseases, damages caused by a heart attack, bone infections, differnet kind of tumors and cancers and many more \cite{mriApplications}.

\section{DCE-MRI}
\textit{Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging} is basically the acquisition of multiple MRI scans, with addition of one extremely important component---the time domain \cite{jackson2005dynamic}. During the examination a Contrast Agent (CA) is injected in the peripheral vein into the bloodstream and the T1-weighted images are acquired. 
The passage of the tracer through the target tissue results in changes in signal intensities over the time.
The analysis of so obtained intensity changes as a~function of time, $S(t)$, provides important functional information \cite{bokacheva2008assessment, khalifa2014models}. 

\begin{comment}
Traditionally, this evaluation is performed by experienced observer, although this method is very subjective and strongly depends on the experience of the expert. Other technique involves fitting tissue intensity changes to pharmacokinetic models, which allows quantification of renal function \cite{khalifa2014models}. Even though this strategy is gaining more and more supporters, most of the methods still require interference of the human at some stage, which makes them vulnerable to human factors.

\subsection{DCE-MRI analysis}
There are many methods of time-courses analysis obtained during DCE-MRI. In general, they can be divided into \begin{inparaenum}[(1\upshape)]\item qualitative \item semi-quantitative \item quantitative \end{inparaenum} methods \cite{barnes2012practical}.
\subsubsection{Qualitative analysis}
In traditional approach, the evaluation of the time-intensity curves is performed by experienced observer via subjective visual inspection, who's task is to classify the curve to one of the predefined enhancement patterns.  This method do not deliver any quantitative parameters and is fully dependent on the observer's experience. The Three types of the \textit{templates} are shown on Figure~\ref{fig:patterns}.

		\label{fig:patterns}
	\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Semi-quantitative analysis}
The semi-quantitative analysis incorporates calculation of parameters directly from the time-intensity curve characterizing its shape. Several examples of the parameters include \textit{onset time} ($T_o$), \textit{maximum signal intensity} ($S_m$), \textit{peak enhancement} ($\Delta S$), \textit{time to peak} ($T_p$), \textit{wash-in slope}, \textit{wash out slope}, \textit{average plateau},  \textit{Area Under the Curve} (AUC) or \textit{Initial Uptake Area Under the Curve} (IAUC). Listed parameters are depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:parameters}.

There is no doubts that obtaining important both structural and functional information in a single imaging session is one of the biggest advantage of Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI.
