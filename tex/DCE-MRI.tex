\chapter{Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI}
	
Medical Imaging started with the development of X-rays by Wilhelm Röntgen in 1895, for which he received a Nobel Price \cite{rontgen1896new}. 
An enormous progress has been done since that time and numerous different imaging methods were developed, which found various applications in a medical field. Possibility of creating  visual representations of human interior as well as tissues and organs processes thus functionality much facilitated medical diagnosis and prognosis.   
Some imaging techniques has became an integral part of clinical care (i.e Computer Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Positron Emission Tomography), whereas there exist one, which still needs to prove its utility. 

In this chapter the imaging technique, which is DCE-MRI will be introduced and its mechanism of imaging will be presented.

\section{MRI---principles of operation}
In order to understand the mechanism of acquiring DCE-MRI sequences, it is inevitable to introduce the principle of operation of \textit{Magnetic Resonance Imaging}~(MRI).

MRI is an imaging technique based on the phenomena of induced nuclear  magnetism in the patient. Every molecule possessing a nuclei with an odd number of protons or neutrons  have a spin, implying a weak though observable randomly oriented nuclear magnetic moment. 
This particles include for example \textsuperscript{1}H, \textsuperscript{13}C, \textsuperscript{31}P, \textsuperscript{23}Na, \textsuperscript{19}F \nocite{bronzino1999biomedical}\cite{biomedical_hanbook_imaging}. If placed in a strong static magnetic field, these moments strongly tend to align parallel to the external field. Some of them will align antiparallel to the field, however there will always be an excess of these directed towards the direction of the field, as this state is more energetically stable. The resulting net magnetic moment, $M_0$, will be directed with the external field.  

Magnetic Resonance Imaging explicit the fact that the human body in 80\% consists of water. During the MRI examination, the object is placed in the scanner producing strong magnetic field, which causes the hydrogen atoms to align in the direction of the field, pointing towards the head of the object as shown in the Figure~\ref{fig:magnetic_field}. 

\begin{figure}

		\label{fig:magnetic_field}
	\end{figure}

\newpage
In addition, atoms have an angular momentum making them precess about the magnetic field direction with a frequency $\omega_{0}$, called the \textit{Larmor frequency}, which is proportional to the field:   
\begin{equation}
\omega_{0} = \gamma{}B_{0}\:,
\label{eq:larmor}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma$ is the nuclei specific constant \textit{gyromagnetic ratio} (for hydrogen equal to 42.6\,MHz/T) and $B_{0}$ is the strength of the external magnetic field. 

Further, when the radiofrequency (RF) pulse equal to the Larmor frequency is applied perpendicularly to the magnetic field, the resonance occurs. The atoms absorb the energy, transits to the higher energy state and flip to the other position.
When the RF transmission is stopped, the atoms return to their equilibrium state (realign to the field $B_{0})$ releasing the energy as a radiation signal, referred to as \textit{free-induction decay} (FID) response signal, which is picked by MRI receiver. This return to equilibrium is called \textit{relaxation}. The relaxation time strongly depends on the surrounding tissue, which means that every tissue generates different response signal. The MRI software analyses and processes obtained signal, which is a combination of numerous response signals from all excited atoms and generates the image.       

During the MRI examination, the strength of the magnetic field produced by the scanner varies along the body, so that the Larmor frequency is different for different regions. By changing frequency of emitted RF, the appropriate part can be imagined. 

The typical MRI scanner consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{The main field magnets}, which produces strong, uniform magnetic field polarizing the sample. Typical strength of the field of a clinical MRI scanner ranges between 0.2--1.5\, T, whereas research systems reaches values even up to 7.4\, T for Human and 21\, T for animal models.
\newpage
\item \textbf{Shim coils.} In clinical practice, the main field magnets never produce perfectly uniform field so the shim coils adjusting its homogeneity have to be used.   
\item \textbf{Gradient coils} producing three secondary gradient magnetic fields in each of the x, y and z direction. In this way, the resonance frequency of protons varies as a function of position, which enables encoding the spatial position and imaging of thin anatomic slices \cite{hidalgo2010theory}.
\item \textbf{RF system}, task of which is to excite the hydrogen atoms and to receive their FID response signal
\item \textbf{The strong computer} controlling the system and processing the received combination of response signals.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\textit{T\textsubscript{1}} and \textit{T\textsubscript{2}} weighted images}

Although, there are few approaches of obtaining the contrast between different tissues in an image, utilizing different tissue properties, most widely used in clinical applications are these based on the relaxation of the magnetization. However, there are two kinds of relaxation, and thus two mechanisms of creating the MRI image can be listed.
\begin{description}
		\item [\textit{T\textsubscript{1}} weighted images] exploits Spin–lattice relaxation, characterised by the time \textit{T\textsubscript{1}}, which describes the time required by excited atoms to return to the equilibrium state after it was altered by the RF pulse. This mechanism is shown in Figure \ref{fig:t1plot}. Sometimes the acquiring of T\textsubscript{1} weighted sequence is preceded by the injection of Gadolinium, paramagnetic contrast agent (CA), which  shortens time {T\textsubscript{1}} and appears very bright on the image. This property is especially useful while visualising vascular structures or brain tumours and abscesses blocking a blood supply.   
		
		\item [\textit{T\textsubscript{2}} weighted images] are based on spin-to-spin relaxation, described by the \textit{T\textsubscript{2}} indicating the time required by the nuclei response signal to decay after it has been created. \textit{T\textsubscript{2}} contrast is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:t2plot}. 
\end{description}

Examples of the images acquired using described above two basic mechanisms are shown in Figure \ref{fig:t1t2}. 
The figure presents identical axial section of a healthy person's brain. In the \textit{T\textsubscript{1}} weighted  image on the left-hand side, one can notice bright ring of subcutaneous fat, which is due to its short spin–lattice relaxation time. Gray matter has longer \textit{T\textsubscript{1}} than white matter, so it appears darker. In the second picture, utilizing the \textit{T\textsubscript{2}} difference between tissues, cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles appears very bright due to its long  \textit{T\textsubscript{2}}. \textit{T\textsubscript{2}} of the white matter is shorter that those of gray matter, which makes the latter one brighter.

Currently MRI is one of the widest used medical imaging techniques. It enables creating detailed anatomical images in all three planes: axial, sagittal and coronal. MRI creates 2d slices
