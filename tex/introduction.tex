Kidneys, although often underestimated, are fundamental organs of human body and their working mechanism is extremely complex. Their essential task is to remove wastes from the organism but their functionality is much wider. They are also involved in maintaining acid-based balance, regulating the blood pressure and are major endocrine organs, which secret three important hormones: erythropoietin, calcitriol and renin. Besides the production, they also take part in degradation of hormones such as insulin or parathyroid hormon \cite{saladin}.
