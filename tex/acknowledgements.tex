First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Professor of the University of Bergen Arvid Lundervold for his enlightening guidance throughout this project and warm hosting me during the stay in Norway, for his encouragement and enthusiastic approach, immense knowledge, and most importantly for inspiring me with the world of medical imaging.

I also would like to thank my supervisors from my mother university, Professor Andrzej Materka and PhD.~Marek Koci≈Ñski for the useful comments and remarks both the substantive and editorial ones, which helped to give this dissertation its final shape. Without their assistance this paper would have never been accomplished.
