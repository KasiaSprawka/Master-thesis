\chapter{The blood filter}
	
There is no life without metabolizing, and metabolism always produces variety of waste products, which accumulated in the tissues are toxic to the organism. Some of them are removed from the body by respiratory tracts, others through digestive system and some of them are extracted through the sweat glands. However, there is no doubt that the urinary system plays the major role in waste extraction \cite{saladin, health_and_disease}.

The main organs of the urinary system are the kidneys. It is them, which perform the filtering function. The remaining ones,  ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra, form the urinary tracts and are responsible only for transforming and storing the urine \cite{saladin}. In this chapter the anatomy and physiology of the kidneys will be briefly introduced.

\section{Structure of the kidney} 

The kidneys are  bean-shaped, usually paired structures located at the back of the abdominal cavity in the retroperitoneal space. They lie at the level of vertebrae T12 to L3.
The right kidney is slightly lower than the left one, because of the close proximity to the the liver \cite{saladin, health_and_disease}. 

The average healthy adult kidney weights around 150\,g, is 11\,cm long, 6\,cm wide and 3\,cm thick \cite{kidney_dimensions, saladin}. As mentioned before, humans usually have two kidneys, however not always.  Some people are born with only one of them.  In such case, the present kidney is as heavy and big as the two kidneys together would be. In most cases it doesn't affect normal live \cite{onekidney}. 

The kidneys are surrounded and protected by three types of connective tissue, from the outer part: 
\begin{inparaenum}[(1\upshape)]
\item \textit{renal fascia} anchoring the kidneys and the neighbouring organs to the abdominal wall;
\item \textit{adipose capsule}, which is a layer of fat tissue holding the kidney in place;
\item \textit{renal capsule}, made of fibrous tissue, firmly enclosing the organ and protecting it from traumas and infections \cite{saladin, health_and_disease}.
\end{inparaenum} In the medial concave surface, there is a~slit called \textit{hilum}, which is the place where the  renal  artery enters and the renal vein and the ureter leave the kidney. The hillum extends into the \textit{renal sinus}, which is a large cavity occupied by blood and lymphatic vessels, nerves, urine-collecting structures and adipose tissue \cite{health_and_disease}.

The renal parenchyma is divided into two major parts: 
\begin{inparaenum}[(1\upshape)]
\item the outer 1\,cm thick portion of the kidney,  \textit{renal cortex}
\item the inner \textit{renal medulla}
 \cite{saladin, health_and_disease}.
\end{inparaenum}
The cortex projects into the kidney forming \textit{renal columns}, which divide the medulla into 10--14 \textit{renal pyramids}. Each of them has a characteristic shape of a cone with the wide base facing the cortex and the tip attached to the sinus called \textit{renal papilla}.  The papilla of each pyramid points towards the \textit{minor calyx} collecting its urine. Few of them converge into the \textit{major calyx}, whereas the all latter ones form the funnel-shaped basin, the \textit{renal pelvis}, which is the extension of the \textit{ureter} transforming the urine to the bladder \cite{saladin, health_and_disease, mosby}. The gross anatomy of the kidney is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:kidney_anatomy}.

\subsection{The nephron} 

As it is with most of the aspects of the human anatomy, the most interesting features of the kidney are invisible with naked-eye. 
The basic microscopic functional units of the kidney are \textit{nephrons}. Above million of them enables the kidney to perform its functions \cite{health_and_disease}. Each of them is a tiny coiled tube, called the \textit{renal tubule}, with a~bulb at the end, the \textit{renal corpuscle}, and extends through both the cortex and the medulla~\cite{saladin}.

The renal corpuscle is composed of the two-layered \textit{glomerular (Bowman) capsule} enclosing the
\textit{glomerulus}, which is a cluster of capillaries. The renal tubule is a~duct leading from the glomerular capsule to the pyramid papilla. It can be divided into several regions, subsequently from the glomerular corpuscle: 
\begin{inparaenum}[(1\upshape)]
\item the \textit{proximal convoluted tubule} (PCT);
\item the \textit{nephron loop (loop of Henle)}, which consists of the \textit{descending and ascending limbs};
\item the \textit{distal convoluted tubule }(DCT);
\item the \textit{collecting duct} receiving the fluids from the DCTs of few nephrons. Multiple of the collecting ducts merge and form a papillary duct, which lead  to the minor calyx.
% \cite{saladin, health_and_disease}.
\end{inparaenum}
Each of the segment has a~distinct cellular appearance and function \cite{saladin, health_and_disease, mosby}.

Every functional unit of the kidney is supplied with the blood by a small blood vessel called the \textit{afferent arteriole}, whereas the \textit{efferent  arteriole} takes it back. The blood leaving the nephron, flows  into  a
network of \textit{peritubular  capillaries} surrounding the renal tubule \cite{saladin, health_and_disease}. The particular parts of the nephron are depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:nephron}.

\section{Functions of the kidney} 

Despite the fact that the key function of the kidneys is purifying the blood, the other ones are equally important. Kidneys are responsible for maintaining the homeostasis of the whole body due to which, all organs can work in an optimal environment.
It is crucial for a proper functioning of whole organism \cite{mosby}. One can conclude that the role of kidneys is enormously important. Indeed, the kidneys are involved in the following processes:
\begin{description}
		%\renewcommand\labelitemi{$\blacksquare$}
		\item [Blood filtering.] The kidneys filter the blood from metabolic waste, excessive amounts of salts, toxins and then excrete unwanted substances in the urine \cite{saladin, health_and_disease, mosby}.
		
		\item [Osmoregulation.]	For a proper functioning of the organism, the concentration of the salts in the body has to remain relatively the same. The kidneys influence this concentration by controlling the amount of water and solutes excreted from the organism \cite{sturkie1986kidneys}.	
		
		\item [Maintenance of water balance.] The kidneys control the amount of water conserved and eliminated in the urine so that the amount of body water remains on the stable level \cite{jequier2010water}.
		\newpage
					
		\item [Blood pressure regulation.] Maintaining the normal blood pressure is achieved in two ways: \begin{inparaenum}[(1\upshape)]\item if the blood pressure drops, the kidneys release the enzyme \textit{renin}, which activates the blood protein \textit{angiotensin}, making the blood vessels to constrict. What is more, angiotensin triggers the mechanism which increases the absorption of water and sodium, which in turn increase the blood volume; \item by regulating the amount of water, which was mentioned before \cite{guyton1972arterial}. \end{inparaenum} 
			
		\item [Maintenance of the acid-base balance.] The food contained in our diet can acidify or alkalize the organism. If the pH level is out of the tolerable boundaries, enzymes and proteins break down, which in extreme cases can lead to death. Kidneys in collaboration with the lungs are responsible for maintaining healthy pH of the body fluids. While the lungs' task is to regulate carbon dioxide ($CO_{2}$) concentration, the kidney acts by reabsorbing or regenerating bicarbonate ($HCO_{3}^{-}$) from the urine and excreting hydrogen ions and fixed acids into the urine \cite{hamm2015acid}.
	
	\item [Red blood cell production.] If the level of oxygen in the tissues is insufficient, the kidneys release \textit{erythropoietin}, the hormone stimulating the bone narrow to red blood cells production \cite{donnelly2001erythropoietin}. 

\item [Keeping the bones strong.] The kidneys, together with the liver, synthesize the active form of vitamin D called \textit{calcitriol} (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol) enabling the body to absorb calcium and phosphorus, which are the crucial minerals for strengthening the bones \cite{williams2009vitamin}.

\item [Prevent the hunger.] In the situation of extreme starvation, the kidneys can synthesize glucose from non-carbohydrate carbon substrates, breaking down other molecules. This phenomena is known as \textit{gluconeogenesis} \cite{newsholme1967control}.
%\item [Hormones degradation.] The kidneys take part in degradation of hormones such as \textit{parathyroid hormone} or \textit{insulin} \cite{emmanouel1980role}.

\subsection{Urine formation} 
Everyday our kidney filter as much as 200 litres of fluid, which is 60 times volume of blood in the body, and excrete 1.5 litres of urine \cite{saladin}. These enormous amounts are a~result of complex process involving numerous exchanges between a nephron and the blood stream. The process of the urine formation can be divided into 4 stages:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{\textbf{Glomerular filtration.}} When the blood enters the glomerulus through the afferent arteriole, the first step begins. Sieve-like walls of the glomerular capillaries  pass every molecule smaller than 3\,nm to the glomerular capsule. These molecules include the water and some solutes as glucose, electrolytes, fatty acids, nitrogenous wastes, amino acids and vitamins. On the other hand, they are impermeable to the larger components such as protein molecules and blood cells.  The diameter of the afferent arteriole is larger than that of efferent one, which gives the capillaries a large inlet and a small outlet. This in turn causes the pressure in the glomerulus to be much higher than elsewhere in the organism. Because the high pressure overrides the reabsorption, the movement of the particles occurs. This movement  of  the components, from  the  blood  into  the Bowman's capsule is known as \textit{glomerular filtration} and the fluid in the glomerular capsule, \textit{glomerular filtrate} \cite{saladin, health_and_disease}.

  
\item{\textbf{Tubular reabsorption.}} The filtrate passing through the renal tubule apart from wastes, contains  also water and many other useful substances such as ions and nutrients, which is a huge loss to the organism. Thus, they are being regained and returned to the bloodstream during the \textit{tubular reabsorption}. The movement is not direct but involves also extracellular fluids and is obtained through the \textit{diffusion}, \textit{osmosis} and \textit{active transport} \cite{health_and_disease}.
 
\item{\textbf{Tubular secretion.}} At this stage the final adjustment of the content of the urine is made. Wastes, toxins and unnecessary substances are passed from the blood to the renal tubule. What is of great importance, in this process also the hydrogen and bicarbonate ions can be removed in order to regulate the acid-base balance of the body \cite{health_and_disease}.

\item{\textbf{Urine condensation.}} When the filtrate enters the collecting duct, it becomes the urine. In order to prevent the water loss and keep the fluid balance of the body, during the last step the water is returned to the tissue fluid and the bloodstream, which makes the urine more and more concentrated \cite{saladin}.

\end{enumerate}
The urine formulated in such a way is then extracted from the organism. The above stages are summarized in Figure \ref{fig:urine}.
\begin{figure}[H]

	\end{figure}

\subsection{Glomerular filtration rate}
\textit{Glomerular filtration rate} (GFR) is a volume of fluid filtered during glomerular filtartion from the renal glomerular capillaries into the Bowman’s capsule per unit time by two kidneys combined and its unit is mL/min \cite{gfr_dictionary}. After standardisation, which is recalculation for standard \textit{body surface area} (BSA), GFR is expressed in mL/min/1.73\,m\textsuperscript{2} \cite{saladin}. 

The GFR in healthy adult kidneys is equal to approx. 90--130\,mL/min/1.73\,m\textsuperscript{2} \cite{normal_values}. Lower at birth, it approaches its adult value at the age of two and maintains its level till the age of forty, when it starts decreasing again \cite{weinstein2010aging}. 
Proper GFR value determines performance of several basic functions of the kidney. Neither too low, nor too high GFR is healthy to the organism \cite{saladin}.

In clinical practice, GFR is an approximate estimator  of the number of active nephrons and is considered as a unit of level of kidney function. What is of great importance, GFR can also determine the stage of chronic kidney disease   \cite{traynor2006measure}.
GFR between 60--120\,mL/min/1.73\,m\textsuperscript{2} is considered a normal, healthy value, below 60\,mL/min/1.73\,m\textsuperscript{2} indicates definite kidney disease, while the number under 15\,mL/min/1.73\,m\textsuperscript{2} is associated with renal failure \cite{national_kidney_foundation_values}. The reference values of GFR are shown in Figure \ref{fig:gfr}.  



\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics [width =12cm]{gfr_values}
		\caption [GFR reference values]{GFR reference values \cite{referencevalues}}
		\label{fig:gfr}
	\end{figure}

Due to the fact that the concentration of the particular substance in the blood and the urine is influenced not only by glomerular filtration, but also by tubular reabsorption and secretion, GFR cannot be measured directly by comparing the urine and blood concentrations. In this way one would rather obtain \textit{renal clearance}, which is a volume of blood plasma from which a particular waste is completely removed in a~unit time \cite{saladin}. This dependency is expressed as follows:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&glomerular\;filtartion\;of\;the\;waste\\
-\quad&tubular\;reabsorption\;of\;the\;waste\\
+\quad&tubular\;secretion\;of\;the\;waste\\
\midrule
&renal\;clearance
\end{aligned}	
\label{eq:gfr_formula}
\end{equation}
For that reason, GFR measurement requires a~substance that is neither secreted nor reabsorbed by the nephrons, which implies that its entire amount in the urine is passed there by glomerular filtration. Unfortunately, there is no single solute appearing in the urine and naturally produced by the body, which doesn't undergo the tubular secretion or reabsorption to some degree \cite{delanaye2012measuring}. 

However, in the nature there appear a substance, which accomplishes the above conditions, namely \textit{inulin}. One method of accurate measurement of glomerular filtration rate incorporates injecting inulin and subsequently measuring the rate of urine output and the concentrations of inulin in the blood and urine. For inulin, the GFR is equal to the renal clearance \cite{saladin, delanaye2012measuring}.


Even though this method is considered the gold standard in the GFR measurement, due to its limitations it is not a clinical routine unless very accurate measurements are required. This special cases include transplant donors or scientific research \cite{traynor2006measure}. 
Other, more frequently used techniques involve using endogenous markers such as \textit{creatinine} and estimating GFR by applying validated algorithms \cite{delanaye2012measuring}. 
%This method is usually accurate enough to be used in clinical practice.
