\subsection{DCE-MRI aquisition}
The dataset used in this project consists of forty DCE-MRI sequences. Each of the 20 healthy, non-smoking participants underwent two MRI examination at a~time interval of 7 days.
A gadolinium-based CA GdDOTA (Gadoteric Acid) at a dose of 0.025\,mmol/kg was administrated as a bolus injection at 3\,ml/s.
The data were acquired on 32 channel 1.5 T whole-body scanner (Siemens Magnetom Avanto \cite{simens}).
The  images covering kidneys and aorta were continuously acquired every 2.3 s for approximately 6 min in coronal-oblique plane.
Each of 74 time volumes consisted of 30 slices.
The aquisition matrix was 192\,x\,192 whereas the voxel size was equal to 2.2\,x\,2.2\,x\,3\,mm$^3$
More information about aquisition of DCE-MRI data used in this project can be found in \cite{eikefjord2017dynamic}.
The few frames of the sample raw DCE-MRI sequence is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:set}.

\subsection{Image processing and analysis}
\subsubsection{Motion correction}
One of the first fundamental problem encountered during DCE-MRI analysis is misalignment of 3D volumes across time slices. This misalignment of organs is a result of the patiens's respiratory motion as well as the heartbeat and bowel peristalsis and is unavoidable during examination. Studies have shown that even slight misalignment can lead to significant differences in intensity time-courses \cite{KidneySubsegmentation} and thus, motion correction of time series is essential for further analysis.

In order to remove motion artifact, all files were motion-corrected across time points. For this purpose R programming language for statistical computing and graphics was used \cite{R} together with the package ANTsR \cite{ANTsR}, which provides quantification tools for biomedical images. As an initial step, for every time series, the algorithm extracted 3D volumes. Each extracted volume corresponded to data obtained in one time point. Next, the average image of the temporal volumes was calculated, which was treated as a mask for image registration. Every temporal volume was then aligned to the mask and at the end they were combined back together into 4D time series.

\subsubsection{Pelvis removal}
Due to the fact that glomelular filtration takes place in renal renal parenchyma, pelvis had to be removed from further analysis. 

Resulting from the physiology of the process, the three renal compartments (cortex, medulla, pelvis) can be distinguished from each other on the basis of their time courses, as shown on Figure~\ref{fig:timecourses}. Depending on the compartment, the rapid enhancement of the signal occurs in different period, which makes the shapes of the time intensity curves very unique.
From the \ref{fig:timecourses} it can be seen that the biggest variation is observed between pelvis and two other renal compartments.    Consequently, it can be separated by unsupervised clustering. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics{img/timecourses}
	\caption{Kidney compartments timecourses  \cite{KidneySubsegmentation}}
	\label{fig:timecourses}
\end{figure}

First of all, every of the the voxel belonging to the label of the kidney was described by the vector of seventy-four features as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:voxel}
\mathbf{v_{ijk}} = [S_{T0},\; S_{T1},\;...\;,\; S_{T72},\; S_{T73}],
\end{equation}
where $S_{Tn}$ is the value of signal intensity in the time point $n$.

However, feature space of seventy-four dimensions is way too much for further analysis. High dimensionality of raw DCE-MRI data results in computational complexity, and thus memory and time consumption as well as numerical problems. What is more it contains a lot of noises \cite{KidneySubsegmentation}. To overcome this problems, the \textit{Principal Component Analysis} (PCA) \cite{wold1987principal} was applied.

PCA is a statistical procedure, which transforms the number of related features into smaller set of uncorrelated variables  \cite{pca}. These so called \textit{Principal Components} (PCs) are a linear combination of the original variables \cite{dunteman1989principal}. As a result, after rotating the feature space, the first PC contains most variance, the last one the least and so on. In this way the dominant patterns are extracted while the noises are reduced~\cite{wold1987principal}. Further, every of the PC is characterised by a ratio of \textit{explained variance}, which indicates the portion of the datasetâ€™s variance lying along the axis of each PC~\cite{handson}.

Applying the theory to practice, each voxel belonging to the kidney, initially described by forty-four features was described by a number of PCs:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:voxelpca}
\mathbf{v_{ijk}} = [PC1,\; PC2,\;...\;,\; PCn]  
\end{equation}
The amount of PCs, $n$, was chosen as a minimum number of dimensions required to preserve 95\% of the data's total variance so that that the sum of the explained variances of  $n$ PCs was equal to at least 0.95 (usually between 4---6 PCs). The visual representation of the feature space with first three dimensions (PCs) for sample kidney is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pca_plot}. Note that for better understanding, the clusters were already marked with different colors.

		\label{fig:pca_plot}
	\end{figure}

To the dimensionally reduced data, the \textit{k-means clustering} \cite{kmeans} was applied in order to separate voxels into two groups: pelvis and renal parenchyma. 
The k-means is an unsupervised clustering algorithm aiming to divide the data into groups so that the diversity between the groups is maximised whereas the similarity within the single group is maximised. 

Given a data set $X=\{ \vec{x_1}...\vec{x_n}$\} in $m$-dimensional space (what actually corresponds to the $m$ features of a sample) the algoritm's objective is to minimize the square error function given by:

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:kmeans}
	J = \sum_{j=1}^{k}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(||x_i-c_j||)^2,
\end{equation}
where $||x_i-c_j||$ is  the Euclidean distance between a data point $x_i$ and the cluster centre $c_j$ of $k$ predefined clusters. It is achieved by the steps summarised in Algorithm~\ref{alg:kmeans}.

\vspace{16pt}
To segment the kidney, the k-means algorithm was initiated with two clusters, $k$~=~2 and performed for points (kidney voxels) in ten-dimensional space (10 PCs).

Furter, for each of the identified clusters, the average time point, $T_{max}$ in which signal intensity reaches its maximum was calculated. 
Following the assumption that $T_{max\_pelvis}>T_{max\_parenchyma}$, the cluster with greater $T_{max}$ was marked as the pelvis and removed from the \textit{Region of Interest} (ROI).
The average time-intensity curves for two detected clusters in k-means clustering algorithm for sample kidney are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:clusters}. On can easily note the wash in phase in pelvis takes place much later than in renal parenchyma. The results of the segmentation in turn are shown in Figure \ref{fig:segmentation}.

\label{fig:segmentation}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Concentration-time curves}
Having labelled the proper ROI, the time has come for the principal part of the analysis, namely pharmacokinetic modelling.
All PK models used during quantitative DCE-MRI analysis call for determining both the tissue, $C_t(t)$, and blood plasma, $C_p(t)$, concentration as a~function of time. In our case, the $C_t(t)$ is the mean concentration in renal parenchyma, whereas the
$C_p(t)$, can be derived from  Arterial Input Function, which is a concentration in a blood vessel feeding the kidney (aorta) \cite{khalifa2014models}. 
Thus, they were calculated in the next steps of the project.  

For each of the kidney, as well as for the aorta, the mean intensities of the voxels included in the particular labels were calculated at the each time point and the time courses were plotted. Sample time courses are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:temporal_points}.

\vspace{10pt}
\begin{figure}[H]
%\captionsetup[subfloat]{captionskip=0.5cm}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{temporal_points}
	
\caption[a]{a}
\label{fig:temporal_points}
\end{figure}




Assuming the linear relation between tracer concentration and signal intensity $S(t)$ \cite{lim2013prediction}, the tracer concentration can be expressed as:


\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:conversion}
	C(t) = S(t)-S_0,
\end{equation}
where $S_0$ is the baseline signal, which is the average signal intensity among the time before the administration of CA. 
In order to determine $S_0$, the time point before rapid signal increase, $T_{baseline}$ had to be found  as marked with red dot in Figure \ref{fig:temporal_points}.
%%% Experimenting with two methods, not decided yet %%%%

To achieve it, firstly, for the purposes of the examination of the function changes, the median filter  with the $kernel\;size = 5$ was applied in order to smooth the signal and eliminate artificial  peaks and valleys, see Figure~\ref{fig:median}  
In next step, for every intensity time course under analysis, its derivative was calculated. The derivative describes the instantaneous rate of change of the function. It tells how fast the output of the function (signal intensity) changes compared to the independent variable (time) \cite{calculus} and seems to be a perfect solution to the problem, which comes down to the finding the most rapid signal change. 
Because of one's interests is detection only of the function's increases, not decreases, the points, in which the derivative is negative were neglected, $S'(t)<0\leftarrow0$. So modified derivative of the sample kidney and aorta are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:derivative}.

Now, all that had to be done to find $t_{baseline}$ was to find the point, in which the derivative of the signal intensity time course reaches its maximum, $t_{baseline}=argmax\;S'(t)$. Having it determined, the $S_0$ was calculated as the mean signal intensity value from the beginning of the measurement ($t=0$) to $t_{baseline}$. Finally, the CA concentration in the tissue and aorta were calculated according to the Formula~\ref{eq:conversion}. The results of intensity-concentration conversion for sample time curves are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:conversion}.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Pharmacokinetic modelling}
Having determined the AIF and the concentration time course for the renal parenchyma, almost all components necessary for the renal  quantitative evaluation were obtained. Almost, but not all. One should take into consideration the fact that AIF is the concentration of CA in the blood of the aorta, which consist of both the red blood cells and the blood plasma. All PK models, however, require the concentration only in the blood plasma. Thus the \textit{hematocrit} (HCT) correction were performed as follows:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:hematocrit}
	C_{p} = C_{AIF} / (1-HCT),
\end{equation}
where HCT is s the volume percentage of red blood cells in blood. In this study, the value was taken from the literature as an average population value and was equal to $HCT=0.43$ \cite{hematocrit}.

Finally, the long-awaited PK modelling could have been performed. The models of choice were the Toft's model, Extended Toft's model, Patlak model and 2-Compartment Exchange model 
 
\paragraph{Toft's model}
The two compartment Toft's model \cite{tofts1991measurement} assuemes the diffusion of the tracer from the blood plasma at rate specified by the transfer constant $K_{trans}$ $(min^{-1})$ and returns at the rate $k_{ep} = K_{trans}/v_e$ $(min^{-1})$. In this model the assumption $C_t(t) = v_eC_e(t)$ is made, which means that plasma contribution is neglected. The blood plasma concentration $C_p$ is specified by AIF. According to the Toft's model the CA concentraion is specified by the formula:
 
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:toft}
	C_{t}(t) = K_{trans}\int_{0}^{t}C_p(t')e^{-(K_{trans}/v_e)(t-t')}dt'  
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Extended Toft's model}
While the Toft's model neglects intravascular contribution assuming weak vascularization of the tissue, the Extended Toft's model \ref{tofts1997modeling} does take it into account. The tissue concentration is described by the formula:
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:extended_toft}
	\nonumber C_{t}(t) &= v_pC_p(t)+\\ 
	&+ K_{trans}\int_{0}^{t}C_p(t')e^{-(K_{trans}/v_e)(t-t')}dt', 
\end{align}
where $v_p$ is the fractional plasma volume. 

In Toft's and extended Toft's models the free parameters $K_{trans}$, $v_e$ and $v_p$ are estimated by fitting the model to obtained in DCE-MRI examinations time concentration curves.  

\paragraph{Patlak plot}
Another proposed approach is the graphical one called Patlak plot \cite{patlak1983graphical}. Patlak plot neglects $k_{ep}$ due to the low permeability and short examination time. As a result tissue concentration is expressed as:

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:patlak}
	C_{t}(t) =v_pC_p(t) + K_{trans}\int_{0}^{t}C_p(t')dt'  
\end{equation}
The above equation is the linearised as:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:patlak_lin}
	Y = K_{trans}X +v_p,  
\end{equation}
where $Y=C_t(t)/C_p(t)$ and $X=\int_{0}^{t}C_p(t')dt'/C_p(t)$. The free parameters $K_{trans}$ an $v_p$ can be then estimating by constructing a linear plot and calculating its slope and intercept respectively.

\subsection{Manual labelling of kidneys and aorta} 
\label{subsec:labelling}
In the next step, labels of both left and right kidney were created. For this purpose, 3D volumes were extracted for every time frame and the image with maximal signal enhancement was chosen (usually between 12--17 time slice). On this image, left and right kidney were manually delineated in coronal plane using ITK-Snap software \cite{itk-snap}. Additionally, few voxels of aorta (15--20) were labelled. So obtained labels were then propagated across the time points. All further analysis was implemented in Python programming language v. 3.6 \cite{python}.  
 


\newpage
\subsection{Pharmacokinetic modelling}
The time-dependent distribution and disposition of a substance in a living system can be described by phamacokinetic (PK) models~\cite{gerlowski1983physiologically}. They aim to characterise a physiologic system by decomposing them into interacting compartments. Every of them is a homogenous, well-mixed space with the uniform tracer distribution \cite{PMID:20540902}.




PK models have very wide clinical application: from estimating the optimal drug dose to determining safe working environment while working with toxins  \cite{gerlowski1983physiologically}.
Given the fact that the contrast agent used in DCE-MRI examination can be considered as a substance flowing through the organism, pharmacokintetic modelling can also be used in analysis of so obtained data.   
This approach, called the parametric one, is based on fitting mathematical model to acquired tissue concentration time courses. In this way, the quantitative parameters can be assessed, which cannot be overestimated while evaluating the renal function.

\end{figure*}

The compartment PK models decribe complex blood-tissue exchanges and their theory is based on the differential mass balance equations \cite{sourbron2011tracer}. 
An example of the system decribed by two compartments is presented on Figure \ref{fig:diagram2}.

Obtained time-concentration curves were then fitted to the described in the next sections PK models.





\subsubsection{GFR estimation}
Having calculated the $K_{trans}$ parameter the glomelural filtration rate can be computed according to the formula:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:gfr}
	GFR = K_{trans}V_{parenchyma}(1-H_{ct}) 
\end{equation}
